        {
          "question": "What is the main purpose of this research project?",
          "answer": "The project aims to develop a smart auxiliary diagnosis system for lung cancer X-ray images based on a CNN-Transformer hybrid model to improve the accuracy and efficiency of early diagnosis. It addresses the limitations of traditional X-ray diagnosis, such as missed diagnoses of small lesions and the difficulty of analyzing complex images."
        },
        {
          "question": "What are the expected outcomes of this project?",
          "answer": "The expected outcomes include one scientific research paper and a comprehensive summary report containing experimental results and interpretability analysis.The system aims to assist clinical doctors by reducing missed diagnosis rates and optimizing medical efficiency."
        }
      ],
      "features": [
        {
          "question": "How does the hybrid model architecture work?",
          "answer": "The system utilizes a \"dual-stream architecture\": a CNN stream (based on ResNet-50) extracts local multi-scale features, while a parallel Transformer stream captures global context and long-range dependencies. These streams interact dynamically through a bidirectional cross-attention mechanism to fuse features before classification."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is the system's decision-making process interpretable?",
          "answer": "Yes, the project integrates Explainable AI (XAI) techniques. It uses Grad-CAM++ to visualize the CNN stream's focus on local lesions and attention maps to show the Transformer's global context focus. This aligns the model's \"focus points\" with clinical diagnostic logic to solve the \"black box\" problem."
        }
      ],
      "technical": [
        {
          "question": "What datasets and data processing methods are used?",
          "answer": "The project uses Kaggle public datasets (IQ-OTH/NCCD, LungCancer4Types, etc.) containing normal, benign, and malignant images. Data processing includes resizing, normalization, and augmentation strategies like random flips and rotation, with a 70% training, 15% validation, and 15% testing split."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is the technical implementation environment?",
          "answer": "The model is implemented using Python and deep learning frameworks, utilizing the Adam optimizer and a weighted cross-entropy loss function.The training process involves five-fold cross-validation to ensure generalization and support GPU acceleration for computation."
